## Features
* Image Support
* Video Support
* Long Press pause and play
* Manual swipe between stories
* Left tap and Right tap gestures to switch between snaps and stories
* If there is no user interruption, it will automatically move to next snap or next story, once progress bar completes.
* Image caching handled using NSCache

## Usage
* Open the project(InstagramStories) folder. You can find the Source folder inside.
* Drag and drop Source folder into your project.
* In your project use same IGStoryPreviewController.
* But don't change default code what we wrote inside IGStoryPreviewController. You can add code on top of that.
* Also don't change CollectionView's custom cell. Use the same IGStoryPreviewCell.
* Because all the functionalities are handled in the IGStoryPreviewCell only.
* If there is any issue or stuck somewhere on configuring Source folder on your project, please raise issues on github. We will reply back as soon as possible.

## We
